Event Genie is a mobile app designed to help college students stay informed about upcoming events and activities on their campus. With this app, students can easily browse through a list of events, register for them, and get notified about event updates and reminders.

The app offers a user-friendly interface that allows students to quickly filter events by category, date, and location. It also provides detailed event descriptions, timings, and locations, as well as the option to RSVP for events they're interested in attending.

The app is built using modern mobile development technologies, and is available for both iOS and Android platforms. It is designed to be easy-to-use and intuitive, making it the perfect companion for any college student looking to stay up-to-date with campus events and activities.

We welcome contributions from developers who are interested in improving the app. Please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests. Together, we can create a powerful and engaging app that helps college students make the most of their campus experience.
